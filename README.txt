How to Run:
You can run the solution by typing the following in terminal:
python main.py

Solution Design Process:
I approached this problem by first writing out the sample data and solution that the assignment
directions provided in testing format.
I made data classes for the input and output formats.
Then I broke down the logic into functions, one function for each collection of data type.
Helper functions then were made to take on repetitive computation tasks.
After all this was complete and the tests were passing, I handled the API GET and POST.

Technical Problems:
I recently switched from CS to DS so I tried taking the Java fundamentals I learned until algo
and learn their Python equivalent which was a bit of a learning curve. Although I had prior 
experience with APIs in a databases class, I had mostly worked with database-backed APIs. 
Handling GET and POST requests for dictionary-based data required reviewing documentation 
and adjusting my approach.
